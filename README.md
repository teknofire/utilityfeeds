Utility feeds
=============

We have designed a mobile application that anyone can use to give accurate location information in real time to first responders.  

We'll also be able to alert those who can help when our children, our parents, our neigbors are in need.

The application is designed to decrease the response time for a local utility to identify and respond to outages, ex: when a snow storm hits and knocks out power.  It keeps the community members informed about local resources base on non-effected locations.

Can be scaled to support communities regardless of size or event.
